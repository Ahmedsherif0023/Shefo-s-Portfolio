## Overview

This is a sleek and responsive to-do list web application built with React. It allows users to manage daily tasks efficiently with a minimalist and user-friendly interface. The app supports adding, deleting, completing, and filtering tasks to help users stay organized and productive.

## Key Features

âœ… Task Management â€“ Add, mark as complete, or delete tasks easily.

ðŸ“‚ Filter Options â€“ View all tasks, completed tasks, or pending ones.

ðŸ’¾ Local Storage Integration â€“ Keeps tasks saved even after refreshing or closing the browser.

ðŸŒ™ Dark Mode â€“ A toggleable dark theme for better UX and accessibility.

âš¡ Responsive UI â€“ Clean and adaptive design across devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: For fast, server-rendered React applications.
- **Figma**: For creating and managing design assets and prototypes.
- **Styled-Components**: For styling React components with a modular, themable approach.

## Challenges and Learnings

State Management â€“ Learned to manage dynamic state effectively using React hooks (useState, useEffect).

Persistence â€“ Implemented localStorage to ensure tasks persist across sessions, which deepened understanding of browser storage.

UI/UX â€“ Designed and refined a responsive and intuitive user experience, learning the importance of simplicity and usability.

Theme Toggle Logic â€“ Building a consistent and smooth dark mode toggle helped improve handling of UI-level global states.

## Outcome

This project helped reinforce core React concepts and introduced essential front-end development patterns like state persistence, conditional rendering, and UI theming. It serves as a solid foundation for future feature-rich productivity apps and showcases your ability to build real-world, user-centered tools.
